/**
  I'm using *MVVM* architecture for News app.

  I'm not able to find any proper public news Api so I'm using newapi https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines.

 - Important: 
 - This API has limit of 100/request per day.
 - I've used a custom card layout for the News Listing. In some places, you can see that the card has a broken UI.
 This is because the image or content is not in the proper format by the API.
 - I've added AppStore card Transition but due to time constraint won't able to deliver it on time
 
 - Tech Stack: SwiftUI, Combine, MVVM
